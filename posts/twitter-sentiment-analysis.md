<h2>Abstract</h2>
Utilizing a pretrained BERT model and Twitter's API, perform sentiment analysis for various meal kit services methods: BERT, Tensorflow, Transfer Learning, Sentiment Analysis

<h2>Summary</h2>
This project initially began as a class project for Stat 576, Data Informatics, at CSULB. We were tasked with exploring a newtechnology. This was my first exposure to neural networks and transfer learning models. The goal of the project was to use  data from Twitter's API and perform sentiment analysis for various meal kit companies. A pretrained BERT model quickly became the frontrunner and was implemented with TensorFlow using Google Colab.
