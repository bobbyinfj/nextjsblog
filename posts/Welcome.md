This portfolio website is built with the <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app">Next.js tutorial</a> as a test case for static generation. 

The previous version of my portfolio website was created from scratch using React and Node.js. This provided me a learning opportunity for frontend web development. Rizwhan Khan's YouTube series leveraging create-react-app was a helpful tutorial in jumpstarting the design. 

So far, I've been impressed with the markdown integration and the ease of rendering at compile time. I'l be looking to integrate react components soon, to show off some of my cool data science toys!
