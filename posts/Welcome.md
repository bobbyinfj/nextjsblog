This portfolio website is built with the Next.js tutorial[^1] as a test case for static generation. 

In creating this portfolio I chose to build it from scratch using React and Node.js. This provided me a learning opportunity for frontend web development. Rizwhan Khan's YouTube series leveraging create-react-app was a helpful tutorial in jumpstarting the design.
