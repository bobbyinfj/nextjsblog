<h2>Abstract</h2>
With the growth of the meal kit industry consumers are faced with a plethora of meal delivery service options. This study surveys current and potential meal kit customers and predicts optimal meal kit choices using statistical and machine learning techniques including user- and item-based collaborative filtering content-based filtering and deep learning approaches. The large number of potential customers who sampled a small percentage of meal kit options presents a challenge in generating optimal predictions. This study implements and discusses the advancement of web-survey methodology and evaluates prediction methods when dealing with sparse data with the goal of providing an optimal model for predicting consumer meal kit service choices.

<h2>Summary</h2> 
One of the fun parts of running a survey is the opportunity to perform EDA (exploratory data analysis). Meal kit service ratings can be visualized a set of histograms using matplotlib. Heat maps are a great way to see the sparsity of ratings data. Sometimes the best visualizations are simple barcharts.
